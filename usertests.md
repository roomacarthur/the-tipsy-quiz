## First Time users:

### 1. As a user I would like to partake in a fun quiz.

When the live site is loaded the homepage has a nice welcoming feeling that asks if you would like to play and directly below is a CTA button to launch the quiz. On all other pages of the site there is at least one link to prompt the user to launch the quiz.

### 2. I would want to be able to quickly check the High Scores.

No matter what page you are on in the header there is a link to the high-scores.
