## First Time Users:

### 1. As a user I would like to partake in a fun quiz.

When the live site is loaded the homepage has a nice welcoming feeling that asks if you would like to play and directly below is a CTA button to launch the quiz. On all other pages of the site there is at least one link to prompt the user to launch the quiz.

### 2. I would want to be able to quickly check the High Scores.

No matter what page you are on in the header there is a link to the high-scores.

### 3. As a user I want the application to be easy to navigate.

There is a clear navigation in the header of all pages, as well as CTA buttons that alow the user to easily move around the application no matter what page they are on.

The home page also offers three large call to action buttons to help the user navigate with ease.

## Returning Users:

### 1. I would want to be able to navigate the site with ease.

Upon returning to the application, it is very easy to navigate, the consistency and style of layout make it easy to quickly pick back up where you left off. The site isn't very large and is straight to the point as there is no more than 2 clicks needed in any instance to get to the desired location.

### 2. I would want to be able to quickly check the High Scores.

Upon returning to the application, one of the 3 CTA buttons on the homepage links straight to the High Scores page along with the header navigation link which is found on every page.

### 3. I would want to be able to remember how to use the application with ease.

The use of a consistent layout and style allows for the user to quickly remember that they have been here before, again with the site not having many pages and no more than 1 or 2 clicks to get to the desired location it is very easy to remember where things are located.

## Site Creator:

For Testing these user stories, I have asked two people questions and noted down their answers after they had some time using the application.

### 1. I want to make the site interactive and fun.

Q. Did you find the website, fun and interactive to use?

A1. Yes, I love a quiz and have missed going to the pub every wednesday night for the quiz, I liked the fact that I could click a button and the question would be read out.

A2. Yes, my partner went first and got a good score and then boasted about it, so we spent half an hour trying to get as high a score as possible and we got a little competitive.

### 2. I want to ensure there are enough questions to prevent the user becoming bored.

Q. Did you feel like there was enough questions when using the application multiple times?

A1. I only maybe played the quiz 3 or 4 times and I can't recall if I got any repeat questions. I did enjoy the fact that there is some nice hard questions thrown into the mix.

A2. We ended up playing the quiz quite a few times, so after a couple goes we did start to see some questions again, so maybe it's an idea to add more?

### 3. I want to make sure the user enjoys their time using the application.

Q. How did you enjoy your time using the application/quiz?

A1. Great, I really enjoyed the colours and style of the Quiz, they usually feel very childish or like no effort has been given to how they look. I feel like you've done a nice job with making it look stylish.

A2. Yes, we're very competitive and had a lot of fun during our time playing the quiz.

### 4. I want to provide easy access to the creator to submit questions.

Q. Did you notice if there was an easy way to contact me via the application?

A1. Yes I saw a messaging part on the website.

A2. My partner did but I didn't, but I didn't even consider the need to contact anyone.
