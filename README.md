### Typography

With the design of 'The Tipsy Quiz' aiming to be fun and interactive, I have picked two fonts that will have a continual use case throughout the design of the site.

1. [Pangolin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pangolin?preview.text=The%20Tipsy%20Quiz&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) - This font is fun and will be used for most of the styling around the site, Headings, Questions, and Answers.
2. [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?preview.text=The%20Tipsy%20Quiz&preview.text_type=custom&query=roboto+s) - This font is an easier to read font and will be used for more in-depth blocks of text. Like on the 'How to' page and which will require this.
