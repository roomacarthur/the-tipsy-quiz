#### Typography

With the design of 'The Tipsy Quiz' aiming to be fun and interactive, I have picked two fonts that will have a continual use case throughout the design of the site.

The initial plan was to use [Pangolin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pangolin?preview.text=The%20Tipsy%20Quiz&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) and [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?preview.text=The%20Tipsy%20Quiz&preview.text_type=custom&query=roboto+s). After initial coding and live site viewing with early deployment via GitPages, I soon realized that the font's chosen would not work, so new fonts where needed. I have settled on the following fonts:

1. [Schoolbell](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Schoolbell?query=school) - A fun and stylish font that is easy to read and will be used for headings.
2. [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) - A very stylish and easy to read font. Will be used for the bulk of text.
3. [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald?query=oswal) - This bold and block style font will be used for links and navigation.

## Testing

## Deployment

### GitHub pages

For a live preview of the site, the code has been deployed via GitHub pages, this has been done at the start of the project to implement device testing as the build progresses.

The steps to deploy via GitHub pages are as follows:

1. Log into Github account.
2. Navigate to the [Repository](https://github.com/roomacarthur/the-tipsy-quiz).
3. Click the 'Settings' option at the top of the repository.
4. Click the 'Pages' option on the left-hand menu, located near the bottom.
5. Within the 'Source' tab Select the drop down titled 'None'.
6. Select the branch named 'main' (in some cases it can be named 'Master').
7. Click 'Save'.
8. You will be prompted with a URL to your deployed site.
9. Site deployed.

When the above steps have been completed, it can sometimes take a little while for the deployed URL to update, So just keep checking back and refreshing the page until your site is visible.
