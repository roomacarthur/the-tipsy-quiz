#### Typography

With the design of 'The Tipsy Quiz' aiming to be fun and interactive, I have picked two fonts that will have a continual use case throughout the design of the site.

1. [Pangolin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pangolin?preview.text=The%20Tipsy%20Quiz&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) - This font is fun and will be used for most of the styling around the site, Headings, Questions, and Answers.
2. [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?preview.text=The%20Tipsy%20Quiz&preview.text_type=custom&query=roboto+s) - This font is an easier to read font and will be used for more in-depth blocks of text. Like on the 'Help?' page, which will require this.

## Deployment

### GitHub pages

For a live preview of the site, the code has been deployed via GitHub pages, this has been done at the start of the project to implement device testing as the build progresses.

The steps to deploy via GitHub pages are as follows:

1. Log into Github account.
2. Navigate to the [Repository](https://github.com/roomacarthur/the-tipsy-quiz).
3. Click the 'Settings' option at the top of the repository.
4. Click the 'Pages' option on the left-hand menu, located near the bottom.
5. Within the 'Source' tab Select the drop down titled 'None'.
6. Select the branch named 'main' (in some cases it can be named 'Master').
7. Click 'Save'.
8. You will be prompted with a URL to your deployed site.
9. Site deployed.

When the above steps have been completed, it can sometimes take a little while for the deployed URL to update, So just keep checking back and refreshing the page until your site is visible.

### Forking The GitHub Repository

To use this code and make changes without effecting the original code you can do what is called 'Forking the repository'. By forking this repository you are given a copy of the code at that moment in time that you can use freely. To fork this repository you need to follow the following few steps:

1. Log into your GitHub account.
2. Navigate to the [Repository](https://github.com/roomacarthur/the-tipsy-quiz), you are wanting to fork.
3. In the upper-right of the repository, click the 'Fork' button.
4. A copy of the Repository will now be available within your own personal repositories.

You will now have a copy of the code available to clone and work on without effecting the original code.

### Cloning the Project.

To make a local clone of the project follow these steps:
